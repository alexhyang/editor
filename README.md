# My personal project - A Text Editor
This project is a ***light-weight text editor*** similar to Notepad++ intended 
for computer users. The editor allows users to create new files in computer, 
open existing files, update the content, and save them to system. 

The reason I decide to create this project is that some seemingly simple desktop
software could have a complex logic behind the screen, such as the Windows' 
built-in Notepad software. Although reinventing the wheel is not a good approach
in practical software construction, it provides an ideal chance to understand 
the problems that will occur under similar circumstances.
