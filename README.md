# My personal project - A Text Editor
This project is a ***light-weight text editor*** similar to Notepad++. Users will be able to create new files in 
computer, open existing files, update the content, and save them to system. 

The reason I decide to create this project is that some seemingly simple desktop software could have a complex 
logic behind the screen, such as the Windows' built-in Notepad software. Although reinventing the wheel is not a good
approach in practical software construction, it provides an ideal chance to understand the problems that will occur 
under similar circumstances.
